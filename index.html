<h3>chapter 1. Creating Your First page</h3><hr>
Every website is a collection of web pages, so it should come as no surprise that your journey
to build a complete site starts <i>here</i> with the writing of a single web page.
<p>
Technically, a web page is a special type of document written in a compueter language called 
<i>HTML</i> ( thats short for HyperText Markup Language).web pages are written for web browser-programs like Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, and Safari. These 
browsers have a simple but crucially important job. they read the html in a web page document anf display the perfectly formatted result for you to read.
